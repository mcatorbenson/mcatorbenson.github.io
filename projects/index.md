### Seasonal hydroclimate reconstructions
One of the most important paleoclimate products ever to have been produced is the North American Drought Atlas (NADA) by Cook et al. (1999). Using a vast network of tree-ring chronologies, the NADA provides spatially gridded reconstructions of estimated summer soil moisture across the continent for the past 300 years. However, due to regional climatology, some tree-ring records in North America are tuned to other climatic signals than that of summer soil moisture. In collaboration with researchers at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, University of Minnesota, and University of Memphis, the Tree-Ring Laboratory at the University of Arkansas has produced a new gridded reconstruction network of seasonal precipitation variability for the North American continent (NASPA). The new dataset partly relies on sub-annual growth measurements (of earlywood and latewood widths) to extract discrete climate information from the trees. Early in this project, I worked on mapping the relationship between these growth variables in previously collected data, as well as producing new measurements of the two. More recently, I have published results from the analyses of drought relief and reversals recorded by the NASPA reconstructions.

### Reconstructing streamflow
Our interest in past climates is connected to the impact current climate extremes have on society today. Water is a scarce resource in many parts of the world but excess amounts can also present problems (e.g., through flooding). Understanding long-term variability of streamflow is therefore an important aspect for both water management and for predicting future risk scenarios. During my time at the Ohio State University, we explored the merging of traditional dendroclimate techniques and hydrological methods. Our initial work included applying simple flow-separation to daily streamflow data prior to assessing signal strength in the tree-ring records. The approach has produced promising results in eastern and central United States, as well as the Czech Republic. I hope to further explore the underlying methodological considerations and to continue this type of work in German river catchments. Current lines of research include more complex hydrological methods to divide streamflow and to associate flow with soil moisture variables thought to limit tree growth. Ultimately, I believe these approaches will not only provide stronger signals in some environments but also produce more robust estimates of uncertainty in all types of environments.

### Understanding temperature influence on tree growth
An underlying assumption in paleoclimate reconstruction exercises is a time-stable relationship between predictor (e.g., tree rings) and predictand/target (e.g., precipitation or temperature). Because the relationship between climate and tree growth is undoubtedly dictated (at least in part) by Leibig's law of minimum, it is likely that the limiting factor has changed over time. The "divergence problem" in dendroclimatology refers - somewhat simplified - to the disconnect of temperature as the main driver of tree-growth at high altitude/latitude sites, as general temperatures increase. Although many studies on this subject have been presented, the full ramifications on paleoclimate reconstructions (and possible solutions) are still not clear. As part of the international MONOSTAR team, lead by Dr. Jan Esper (JGU Mainz, Germany), we hope to help make progress in this important area of long-term climatology. These questions tie into larger paleoclimate themes of noise, uncertainty estimates, and the potential of non-linear signals - which has often been points of focus in my previous research. One of the tools available to us for understanding tree growth and its relation to external (climatic) factors is tree-growth models.
