In the case of any questions or requests for any previously published papers in PDF format, please use one of the following ways to get in touch with me:

1. Email is the most reliable way to reach me (mtorbens (at) tamu.edu).
2. [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Max-Torbenson)

My office is located in the Eller Oceanography and Meteorology building at the Texas A&M University campus in College Station, Texas. Currently, I only accept meetings of prior agreement.
