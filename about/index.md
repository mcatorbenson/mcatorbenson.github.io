# About
As of January 1st 2026, I serve as an assistant professor with the <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/geography/index.html">Department of Geography</a> at Texas A&M. Previously, I worked as a research associate with the <a href="https://www.climatology.uni-mainz.de">Tree-Ring Lab</a> at Johannes Gutenberg-Universität-Mainz, and in the <a href="https://www.jstagge.com">Stagge Hydrology Lab</a> (Department of Civil Engineering) at the Ohio State University. I received my Ph.D. in Geoscienes from the University of Arkansas (<a href="https://dendro.uark.edu/">UARK Tree-Ring Lab</a>). Prior to obtaining my master's degree in Geography from the University of Minnesota (at the Center for Dendrochronology), I studied for a Bachelor of Science in Archaeology and Palaeoecology at Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. My research interests mainly revolve around tree growth and past and current climate variability.
