## About
As of January 1st 2026, I am an assistant professor with the Department of Geography at Texas A&M. Previously, I worked as a research associate with the tree-ring lab of the Institute of Geography at Johannes Gutenberg-Universität-Mainz, and in the Stagge Hydrology lab (Department of Civil Engineering) at the Ohio State University. I received my Ph.D. in Geoscienes from the University of Arkansas (UARK Tree-Ring Laboratory). Prior to obtaining my master's degree in Geography from the University of Minnesota (at the Center for Dendrochronology), I studied for a Bachelor of Science in Archaeology and Palaeoecology at Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. My research interests mainly revolve around tree growth and past and current climate variability.

One of the first scientific discoveries we make as kids is that trees form rings over time. These rings are annual features in most tree species found outside of the tropics, and how well a tree grows (and therefore the how wide a ring becomes) is dependent on several factors including climate. Simplified, growth is limited by soil moisture in arid regions and by temperature at cold sites. The shared variability in year-to-year growth across a stand of trees, or trees from a whole region, is the basis of our science - dendrochronology. Tree rings have been used to date archaeological artifacts with unrivaled precision, and have provided a greater understanding of many of our planet's ecosystems. The relationship between tree-growth and climate has also allowed for the reconstructions of past changes in temperature and precipitation regimes. This information is crucial because our observational record of 100 years or so (at best) does not encompass the full variability of Earth's climate. By using tree rings as a proxy, we can extend the climate records hundreds, if not thousands, of years back in time.
